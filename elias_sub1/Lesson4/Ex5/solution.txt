The class somefunction_t takes a binary function and two unary functions
and allows to call itself. -->
somefunction_t(BinOp, U1, U2)(x)

Where x is an argument with which both unary functions get called and their
results are passed to BinOp in order, providing a new result value.

This can be useful if you have a binary function, of which both arguments you want to give to it
 depend on one single value, which have to be transformed to another format before passing it to the binary function.
